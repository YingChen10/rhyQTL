24-hour biological rhythms are essential to maintain physiological homeostasis. Disruption of these rhythms increases the risks of multiple diseases. The biological rhythms are known to have a genetic basis formed by core clock genes, but how individual genetic variation shapes the oscillating transcriptome and contributes to human chronophysiology and disease risk is largely unknown. Here, we mapped interactions between temporal gene expression and genotype to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) contributing to rhythmic gene expression. These newly identified QTLs were termed as rhythmic QTLs (rhyQTLs). Specifically, we identified rhyQTLs and rhyQTL-associated genes (rhyGenes) inÂ 45 human tissues using data from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. 

This repository contains all source code for the analyses in manuscript "[Human genetic variation determines 24-hour rhythmic gene expression and disease risk](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4790200/v1)".
