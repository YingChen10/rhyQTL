# rhyQTL

24-hour biological rhythms are essential to maintain physiological homeostasis. Disruption of these rhythms increases the risks of multiple diseases. The biological rhythms are known to have a genetic basis formed by core clock genes, but how individual genetic variation shapes the oscillating transcriptome and contributes to human chronophysiology and disease risk is largely unknown. Here, we defined a new class of genetic variation, termed rhythmic quantitative trait loci (rhyQTL), determining the variation in rhythmic gene expression. Specifically, we identified rhyQTLs and rhyQTL-associated genes (rhyGenes) inÂ 45 human tissues using data from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project.
